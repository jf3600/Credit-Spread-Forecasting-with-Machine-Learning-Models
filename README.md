# Credit-Spread-Forecasting-with-Machine-Learning-Models

This paper attempts to investigate the year-to-year variation in credit spread between invest- ment grade corporate bonds and US treasury bonds associated with economic and financial predictors. Methodology is explained in detail, before an account of data preparation steps is given. Inspired by the Merton’s credit default risk model (1974), we start with linear re- gression as a benchmark test, and eventually turn to a host of machine learning techniques including LASSO regression, random forests and boosting algorithm. Ultimately, we aim to forecast the direction and the magnitude of such credit spread. Boosting method, supported by our statistical findings, turns out to be the best performer. Our conclusion is that, at a monthly level, the interest rate spread between AAA and BAA rated cooperate bonds and US Treasury bonds will be increasing at a decreasing rate.
